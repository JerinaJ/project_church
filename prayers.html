        <p>Unfailing Prayer to St. Anthony </p>
        <h2>Blessed be God in His Angels and in His Saints</h2>
        <p>St. Anthony, gentlest of Saints, your love for God and charity for his creatures, made you worthy, when on
earth, to possess miraculous powers. Miracles waited on your word, which you were ready to speak for those
in trouble or anxiety. Encouraged by this thought, I ask you to obtain for me the favors that I seek.(mention your request here) The answer to my prayer may require a miracle, even so, you are the Saint of Miracles. O gentle and loving St. Anthony, whose heart was full of sympathy, whisper my petition into the ears of the Infant Jesus, who loved to be held in your arms; and the gratitude of my heart will ever be yours.
Amen
