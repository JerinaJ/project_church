        <h1>Story of St.Antony</h1>
        <p>St. Anthony of Padua is one of the Catholic Church's most popular saints. Saint Anthony of Padua, patron saint of lost and stolen articles, was a powerful Franciscan preacher and teacher. He's typically portrayed holding the child Jesus or a lily or a book or all three in his arms.</p>
		<h2>Early Life and Priesthood</h2>
        <p>St. Anthony, whose baptismal name was Ferdinand, was born in Lisbon in 1195, the eldest son of an influential family. His parents had great plans for him, and so they arranged for a proper early education. They were thinking of an ecclesiastical or bureaucratic career, but Ferdinand disappointed them by choosing a life more directly dedicated to the service of the Lord.</p>
        <p>When he was fifteen, after much prayer and reflection, he left his rich home and went to live in the Augustinian Abbey of St. Vincent on the outskirts of Lisbon.Ferdinand begged his superiors for a transfer to another abbey, and they sent him to the Augustinian Abbey of the Holy Cross in Coimbra (which at that time was the capital of Portugal). There he continued his studies and was ordained to the priesthood when he was 25 years old.Ferdinand eventually obtained permission from his superiors to join the Franciscans. He was invested with the Franciscan habit and began to learn the teachings of their holy founder St. Francis.
With this new life style, he also took on a new name. He called himself Anthony, after the hermit St. Anthony of the desert to whom the Franciscan hermitage was dedicated.</p>
            <h2>Teacher, Preacher, Doctor of the Scriptures</h2>        <p> His effectiveness as a preacher calling people back to the faith resulted in the title Hammer of Heretics. Just as important were his peacemaking and calls for justice.All throughout Lent of 1231 he preached to ever increasing crowds in Padua, but his preaching and the endless hours of confessions left him prostrate. Around this time, Anthony had a premonition of his approaching death.One night Count Tiso was passing by Anthony's room when he was attracted by a powerful light.There he saw Anthony in ecstasy embracing the Infant Jesus. On June 13, 1231, 36 years old Antony handed his spirit in God's Hand.  </p>
			<h2>Sainthood</h2>
			<p>The bishop of Padua, and Pope Gregory IX, immediately began to promote his canonization. Anthony was so well known and his holiness so universally attested that the investigation lasted less than a year. On May 30, 1232, Pope Gregory canonized Anthony of Padua.</p>
			<p><span class="content">Today St. Anthony is truly a universal saint, respected and venerated even by non-Christians. He is especially known as the patron saint of the lost, for all throughout his life he restored things back to people who had lost them: for some it was their health, for others their hope, for still others their virtue, and for many their faith. Today, as in the 13th century, we call out, "St. Anthony, pray for us!"</span></p>
